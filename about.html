        <p id="about">
            Da Shed Armwrestling club was originally founded by amateur armwrestlers Will Smith and Kody Byrd of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. When the two realized that there was no regular practices being held in Mississippi, they decided to begin practicing with each other in a shed in Will's back yard. Soon, the word began to get out to other beginners looking to find a start in the sport and thus, Da Shed Armwrestling Club was born. The club has since grown to having regular practices at Revolution Fitness with regular attendees including multiple state champions BJ Fokakis and Wayne Withers and World Champion Dustin Hyatt. Our goal is to foster all new-comers in Mississippi into high level armwrestlers to put the state on the map to compete against it's neighboring states on the national level. For this reason, every person who loves the sport of Armwrestling is openly invited to attend any practice posted to the public to learn how to dominate their opponents on the table.
